# Pictographer

The pictographer is a project we started to help out with a project for a calculus class. The program prompts a user to select an image file and enter a polynomial function, and then draws the graph of the function on top of the image. The function can only be a polynomial function, because that's the easiest to parse for, and because a polynomial function can approximate any other type of function. The window settings of the graph are fully customizable.

Along with all of the source code, in the root folder of this repository you'll find [detailed documentation](javadoc) and a compiled .jar version of the project.
